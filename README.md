# Wellcome to 60-minutes-to-start-pytorch!
StudyPytorch_within_60min is a program that introduces the basics of PyTorch, a popular open-source machine learning library. This program covers the installation process, tensor initialization, autograd, neural networks, and training of image classifiers.


## The goal of this program

To get started with pytorch easily, I conclude some keypoints of the official documents which will be mentioned at the last part of this readme file.

## Initialization of Tensor

In this section, you will learn how to install PyTorch and the torch.tensor library, which is a fundamental data structure in PyTorch. You will learn how to create and manipulate tensors.

## Autograd

PyTorch's automatic differentiation engine, torch.autograd, is at the heart of neural network training. In this section, you will get a conceptual understanding of how autograd helps a neural network train.

## Neural Networks

Neural networks can be constructed using the torch.nn package. This section will cover the basics of neural network construction, including layers, activation functions, and loss functions.

## Train Your Network

In this section, you will learn how to train an image classifier using PyTorch. You will perform the following steps:

Load and normalize the CIFAR10 training and test datasets using torchvision.  
Define a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).  
Define a loss function.  
Train the network on the training data.  
Test the network on the test data.  
These steps will give you a good foundation for training your own neural networks.

This program is based on the PyTorch official guide named "Deep Learning with PyTorch: A 60 Minute Blitz" written by Yang Zongxian. You can find the detailed guide at https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/deep_learning_60min_blitz.html.

All the official documents can be found with the filename "_Official",you can also learn from the official documentation if there are some misunderstanding.
